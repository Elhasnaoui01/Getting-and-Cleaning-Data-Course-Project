## Variables

- `subject`: The ID of the test subject.
- `activity`: The type of activity performed.
- `TimeBodyAccelerometerMean...X`: The mean value of body accelerometer signal in X direction.
- `TimeBodyAccelerometerMean...Y`: The mean value of body accelerometer signal in Y direction.
- `TimeBodyAccelerometerMean...Z`: The mean value of body accelerometer signal in Z direction.
- `TimeBodyAccelerometerSTD...X`: The standard deviation of body accelerometer signal in X direction.
- `TimeBodyAccelerometerSTD...Y`: The standard deviation of body accelerometer signal in Y direction.
- `TimeBodyAccelerometerSTD...Z`: The standard deviation of body accelerometer signal in Z direction.
- (Include other variables accordingly)

## Data

The data used in this project were collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The dataset includes recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

## Transformations

1. Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
